# Density Based Clustering
DBSCAN stands for Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise. This technique is one of the most common 
clustering algorithms which works based on density of object. The whole idea is that if a particular point belongs to a cluster,
it should be near to lots of other points in that cluster.

DBSCAN is used here to find the group of weather stations which show the same weather condition. 
As you can see, it not only finds different arbitrary shaped clusters, can find the denser part of data-centered samples 
by ignoring less-dense areas or noises.
